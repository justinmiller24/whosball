# WHOSBALL

>Automated Foosball Table

Every year, I accept an annual "challenge" of some kind. In past years, this has been anything from running a marathon (2007) or completing a 1/2 ironman (2010) to a food challenge (2012) or even trying out for American Ninja Warrior (2018). According to StrengthsFinder, "learner" is my #1 strength, so the goal is to continually push myself into new areas that I'm less familiar with so that I continue to expand my horizons and grow as a leader.

This year (2020), I've accepted the challenge to build an Automated Foosball Table. This will allow me to gain working knowledge of Python, OpenCV, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), as well as brush up on other areas including robotics, physics, electrical engineering, and programming. As an added benefit, it will also allow my oldest daughter (6 yr) to be able to play foosball any time she wants, even when I'm not available.

The basic setup will be a foosball table and a camera connected to a Raspberry Pi. This will allow for image detection to be able to detect the position and velocity of the foosball in real time. This information will be fed into the main script, which will be running 24/7 and will allow the Raspberry Pi to control linear and rotary motors that are connected to the rods on one side of the foosball table. The end goal is to complete a working prototype of a foosball table that is capable of beating a human at the game of foosball by midnight on Dec 31, 2020.
