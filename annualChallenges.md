## Background
Every year, I accept an annual challenge. In past years, this has been anything from learning to juggle (2003) to running the [Disney Marathon](https://www.wdwmagic.com/events/walt-disney-world-marathon.htm) (2007) or [Half Ironman](https://www.ironman.com/im703-races) (2010), to the Buffalo Wild Wings [Blazin' Challenge](https://www.buffalowildwings.com/en/food/sauces/blazin-side-of-sauce/) (2012), or even trying out for [American Ninja Warrior](https://www.nbc.com/american-ninja-warrior) (2018). I'm a problem solver by nature, so the goal is to continually push myself into new areas so I can continue to learn and grow.

For 2020, I accepted the challenge to build an automated foosball table. Imagine a normal game of [foosball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_football), except your opponent is a computer. I accepted this challenge because it aligns closely with my background in technology and it will also allow me to gain working knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (computer vision), and [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI). In addition, it will expand my knowledge in other areas including robotics, physics, and mechanical engineering.

The end goal is to complete a working prototype of a foosball table that is capable of beating a human at the game of foosball by midnight on Dec 31, 2020.

While I did not formalize the concept of doing an annual challenge until the last few years, looking back, it has become clear that I have naturally gravitated towards challenges like this most of my life. Below is a list of the "challenges" I have taken on since early grade school.
